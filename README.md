# claude-code-plugins

A personal marketplace of Claude Code plugins — self-contained bundles of skills, agents, and slash commands that extend Claude Code's capabilities for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Summary

This repository is both the plugin source and the marketplace registry it publishes from. Each plugin is an independently versioned, self-contained unit that Claude Code can install directly. Plugins extend Claude Code with purpose-built workflows for git, code review, documentation, UI development, backend development, and architectural governance.

## Installation

Install a plugin from this marketplace by pointing Claude Code at this repo's marketplace registry:

```bash
# Add this marketplace to Claude Code
claude plugins marketplace add https://github.com/dnlopes/claude-code-plugins
```

Then install individual plugins:

```bash
claude plugins install curator
claude plugins install git-workflow
claude plugins install governor
```
